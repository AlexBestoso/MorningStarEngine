This is a passion project of mine. As I build out the code, there will eventually be an actual game made with it.<br>
The intedented uses for this software are planned to be:
<ul>
<li>2D and 3d game development</li>
<li>General graphical applications</li>
<li>Advanced math calculations</li>
</li>Physics simulation and testing</li>
<li>The further proliferation of linux supremacy</li>
</ul>
