# MorningStarEngine

run "make" from the terminal to compile the application.

The Morning Star Engine is a graphical application created in OpenGL for the Linux Operating System. 

As of writing this README, the foundation of the software has been laid, and is still subject to change.

As it sits, it's not pretty; but you can create and load projects. 

What's to come in the future? Right now I'm building out the actual development environment. 

Currently nothing can be created with the software, but it so far features working menues and buttons. 

Textures can also be added to menues. The software only supports .bmp image files at this time, as everything is being programmed from scratch. 

The goal of this software is to create an open source Game/Simulation engine without including anyone else's code. 

Follow the project to stay up to date! :)
