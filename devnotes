System Init Dev Notes
	Utilize the environment variables to get to the user's /home/user/.mty_storage
		Default to /tmp/mty_storage and display a warning that no HOME variable was found.
	
	check if the .mty_challenge file exists, if not, system needs to be initialized. 

	Challenge file will contain the phrase: 
		"A fat monkey once tried to take my marbles. I retaliated by taking his bananas."
	
	The user will be prompted: 
		- where to store their storage data, where the above default is added automatically.
		- A user name, which will be used for IV generation. 
		- A password, which will be used for AES key generation.

	Upon form submission, a file named /home/user/.mty_config will be created. The file will contian:
		storageLocation:/home/user/.mty_storage
		audioOptions:Some Value
		customDisplayOptions:Some Value
		autoLogoutTime: some value
	
	The file is then encrypted using typed IV and Key, which is stored in the SecurityGuard class during the duration of program execution.

	Required values are then stored into the context provider during program execution. 

	There must be an automated logout feature that activates after x amount of inactivity. Which will clear the key and IV from memory.
